Another ingenious solution for habitual snoozers is Ruggie, which looks more or less like a well-cushioned floor matt. To turn off this innovative alarm, you actually need to step on it for three full seconds ‚Äì and get out of bed in the process. Pros: Kiss the temptation to snooze goodbye and start your mornings on time.

Participants answered that they are late for various reasons. Major reasons they fail to be on time at work/school were not only due to the failure to wake up on time (61%) but also the failure to leave their home on time (29%). There are four primary causes for that: 1) habitual snooze (53%), 2) missing an ideal time for leaving home (24%) 3) miscalculation of the amount of the time for enough sleep, preparation, and commute time (10%), 4) accidentally not setting up an alarm clock (8%).<br><br> I also learned that people use multiple alarms for different times and use additional methods to make sure to wake up (e.g., analog alarm clock, alarm clock app that forces you to wake up physically, family/friends' help)."

            "desc": "In this paper, we present BubbleView, an alternative methodology for eye tracking using discrete mouse clicks to measure which information people consciously choose to examine. BubbleView is a mouse-contingent, moving-window interface in which participants are presented with a series of blurred images and click to reveal 'bubbles' - small, circular areas of the image at original resolution, similar to having a confined area of focus like the eye fovea. Across 10 experiments with 28 different parameter combinations, we evaluated BubbleView on a variety of image types: information visualizations, natural images, static webpages, and graphic designs, and compared the clicks to eye fixations collected with eye-trackers in controlled lab settings. We found that BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information visualization or measuring image importance. BubbleView data is cleaner and more consistent than related methodologies that use continuous mouse movements. Our analyses validate the use of mouse-contingent, moving-window methodologies as approximating eye fixations for different image and task types.",

A storyteller can use DataToon rapidly generate visualization panels, annotate them, and position them within a canvas to produce a visually compelling narrative. In a user study, participants quickly learned to use DataToon for producing data comics."
